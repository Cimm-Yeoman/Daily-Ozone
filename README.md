# Daily-Ozone
This data set includes the environmental variables ozone, humidity, and temperature, along
with day of the week and day of the year. Ozone has some level of a relationship with human 
disturbances, especially actions which alter temperature, such as vehicle use and and 
greenhouse gas outputs. This report will attempt to predict the daily ozone level, our
response, with a multiple regression Bayesian framework. A smoothing spline will be implemented
to help make predictions and identify patterns in the data set.
